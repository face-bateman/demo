              The burden of proof is on the prosecution/plaintiff. Law Enforcers of Face (Officers) investigate certain misbehavior even if nobody presses charges against them.

              We're not Barbarians who conduct street justice when there is a dispute. Whatever problem our citizens face(change this), they are to report it to our officers. Under any circumstances, you are not to go off on each other; you are not to "correct" each other; you are not to quarrel in guild chat or guild's Discord. It's not because we want to cover stuff up and paint a false picture; but because even a small issue brought to the center stage can have a thousand fold effect, and it would annoy everyone seeing it. Officers are trained on how to respond and how resolve problems. All you need to do is to bring up your story and your evidence to an officer. We're members of the same community; instead of expecting the worse from each other, having a sincere conversation first will mostly be more than enough and a blessing in disguise. In fact, not talking to related people kindly and rushing to an office immediately would just make the issue linger longer because the officer will try to create a resolving communication between related parties.

              We're not snowflakes, a good joke is a good joke, but if you're not a skilled joker, best leave joking on controversial stuff to Louis CK or Delphi.

              There may be times and situations where and when it gets tricky to monitor behavior, collect evidence, and exercise the Law. There also may be things fairly new to the guild to address. In such situations and times, we depend on our members' trust in our ability to sustain order and our intention for fairness. A good citizen reports to an officer if they see something. Because if things go unnoticed and unreported, they may become more problematic in time. It's better to fix things when they are still smaller.
